# mediterranean-beach-apartment

My friend Jana has an apartment in Croatia, and she'd like your help in helping make a simple landing page that would represent her place. She's from Rijeka, so you might want to use some images from the place, show the seaside, and other relevant stuff.

Think about typical stuff usually found in projects like this. General page info, room availability, photoos, location, maybe a booking form and calenadr, stuff like that.

Try to achieve mediterranean vibe
